Heres an explanation of some of the git configuration settings listed, along with how to use them:

1. credential.helper=osxkeychain
    - This setting tells Git to use the macOS Keychain to store credentials like username and password.

2. init.defaultbranch=main
    - This setting specifies \"main\" as the default branch name for newly initialized repositories.

3. credential.helper=cache
    - This configuration enables Git to cache credentials in memory for use by future Git commands.

4. core.repositoryformatversion=0
    - This indicates the format version of the repository. The version 0 is the current default version.

5. core.filemode=true
    - When true, Git will respect file mode changes (i.e., executable bit changes in files).

6. core.bare=false
    - This setting indicates that the repository is not a bare repository (i.e., it has a working directory).

7. core.logallrefupdates=true
    - This setting makes Git log updates to the \"refs\" directory.

8. core.ignorecase=true
    - When true, Git treats file names as case insensitive. Useful on case-insensitive file systems.

9. core.precomposeunicode=true
    - This makes Git decompose Unicode composed forms. Useful for macOS file systems.

10. remote.origin.url=git@github.com:samehshi/portfolio.git
    - This is the URL of the remote repository. This is where the git push and git pull commands will send and fetch data from.

11. remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    - This specifies how to map branches from the remote repository to the local repository.

12. branch.master.remote=origin
    - This indicates that the \"master\" branch is tracked from the \"origin\" remote.

13. branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
    - This indicates that the branch \"master\" is set up to merge with the remote \"master\" branch.

To make changes to these settings, you can use the \"git config\" command. For example, to change the default branch name for new repositories, you can run:

```
git config --global init.defaultbranch main
```

If you need to configure any specific setting or need more information on a particular configuration, let me know!
