## Methodology

I approached this analysis in a structured manner to ensure comprehensive coverage and generate actionable insights:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preparation:**

   - I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, containing information on 14,999 employees.
   - The dataset includes factors such as satisfaction levels, performance reviews, workload, tenure, work accidents, promotions, department, and salary.
   - I meticulously cleaned and preprocessed the data to maintain accuracy and integrity.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   - I conducted a comprehensive EDA to explore relationships between variables and identify potential turnover drivers.
   - My analysis included:
     - Visualization techniques: histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, and stacked bar charts.
     - Statistical analysis: descriptive statistics, t-tests, and ANOVAs to compare different groups.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**

   - I built predictive models to identify the most influential factors impacting employee turnover:
     - Logistic Regression for predicting whether an employee will leave or stay.
     - Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting Models to identify complex relationships and provide insights into feature importance.
   - I evaluated the models using key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC.

4. **Interpretation and Recommendations:**
   - I analyzed the model results to identify key features influencing turnover predictions.
   - I translated these insights into actionable recommendations for our HR department.

## Key Findings

- **Employee satisfaction** is the strongest predictor of turnover. Low satisfaction significantly increases the likelihood of an employee leaving.
- **High last evaluation scores** are unexpectedly linked to turnover. This suggests dissatisfaction among high performers, possibly due to a lack of growth opportunities or feeling undervalued.
- **Low salary** is a major risk factor. Competitive compensation is crucial for retaining talent.
- **Longer tenure** correlates with higher turnover, highlighting the need to focus on engagement and career development for long-term employees.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Employee Satisfaction:**

   - Implement regular satisfaction surveys (quarterly or pulse surveys).
   - Take swift action based on feedback to show employees their voices are valued.
   - Invest in recognition programs to acknowledge and reward contributions.

2. **Re-evaluate Performance Reviews:**

   - Focus evaluations on career development, not just performance assessment.
   - Provide clear career paths, training programs, and advancement opportunities.
   - Tie meaningful rewards to performance for top performers.

3. **Review Salary Structure:**

   - Conduct industry and regional salary benchmarking.
   - Establish transparent salary bands and criteria for raises and promotions.

4. **Address Workload and Tenure Concerns:**
   - Promote work-life balance through flexible arrangements and encouraging vacation time.
   - Implement programs recognizing loyalty and offering career reinvention pathways for long-term employees.

## Impact

By implementing these recommendations, I believe we can create a more engaged and satisfied workforce at Salifort Motors. This will reduce turnover, save costs on recruitment and training, and ultimately boost our productivity and organizational success.
