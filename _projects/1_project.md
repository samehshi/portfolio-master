This project is a part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It involves the analysis of a dataset related to a fictional bike-sharing company, Cyclistic. The goal is to provide insights that can help the company understand how different customer types use their bikes differently, and how Cyclistic can use these insights to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Cyclistic Bike-Share: Turning Casual Riders into Members

**Objective:** We analyzed one year of Cyclistic bike-share data to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, with the goal of developing strategies to convert casual riders into members.

**Key Findings:**

- **Annual members use bikes primarily for commuting:** Their usage is consistent throughout the weekdays, with shorter ride times.
- **Casual riders use bikes for leisure:** Their usage peaks on weekends and during summer, with longer ride times.
- **Electric bikes are popular, especially among members:** This indicates a preference for assisted riding.
- **Ridership spikes in summer and falls during winter:** Weather plays a major role in bike usage.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Target casual riders with a commuting-focused marketing campaign:**
   - Highlight the benefits of cycling for work: save money on gas, avoid traffic, and contribute to a healthier lifestyle.
   - Promote the campaign on professional social media platforms (LinkedIn) to reach the target audience effectively.
2. **Incentivize winter ridership:**
   - Offer discounts or special promotions during colder months to encourage year-round usage.
3. **Showcase the versatility of Cyclistic bikes:**
   - Run advertising campaigns that demonstrate bikes are suitable for both commuting and recreation.
   - Emphasize practicality and bike availability. Target these campaigns on platforms frequented by potential casual riders.

**Impact:** By understanding how casual riders differ from members, we can tailor our marketing to effectively convert them, leading to increased membership, higher revenue, and a more sustainable transportation system.
